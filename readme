Welcome to the CubeQE user manual
The CubeQE application is in prototype state, so there is no installation but a configuration to do to repeat the same experiments.
In order to use CubeQE, we will describe the installations and the classes to use.

1. Facilities
- Install a Java IDE (IntelliJ (recommended), Eclipse, Netbeans)
- Install JDK 11
- Installing Scala 2.12.9
- Install Apache Tomcat 9.0
- Download source code from GitHub
- Download the query logs from https://aksw.github.io/LSQ/

2. Classes to use
- Change in the "Declarations" class (under src / java / Services / MDfromLogQueries / Declarations) the root and rootTdb variables by the directory where you want to save the results.
- Execute the "DirectoryCreation" class (under src / java / Services) by changing the endpoint according to the desired endpoint (dbPedia, DogFood, etc.) to create a backup directory.
- Add the query log in the "Data Log / logs" folder under the created directory.
- Run the "Scenario_logOnly" class (under src / java / Services / Scenarios) for scenario 2. (Choose the LogCleaning or LogCleaningOneFile class depending on whether the query log contains multiple files or only one)
- Run the "Scenario_Analytic" class (under src / java / Services / Scenarios) for scenario 1. (Run scenario 1 after scenario 2 because scenario 2 uses the log cleanup results performed in scenario 2.
- After execution of scenario 2, run the class "Scenario_Enrichment" (under src / java / Services / Scenarios) for scenario 3.

NB: At the level of the classes of Scenario the uri and the endpoint are modifiable according to the log used (variables endpoint and endpointUri)

In order to visualize the results:
- Create an artifact for the web application and launch it.
- View the results.

Note: Scenario execution takes a lot of time, including Scenario 2 for dbpedia, which takes up to 5 days.
Note 2: There are specialized classes for running WikiData query logs
